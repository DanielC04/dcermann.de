# Portfolio website 
This simple React portfolio is supposed to make job and university easier and faster. It's like an overview of my current skills, projects and goals.
It's based on [this project] (https://github.com/Dorota1997/react-frontend-dev-portfolio) but strongly modified for my needs.
Used technologies:
- React + TypeScript
- SASS
